# Frontend

This directory contains a simple React application demonstrating the look and feel of the platform.

## Files


The app demonstrates several features:

- A "Say Hello" button that calls `/api/hello` and shows the response
- Fetching `/api/recommendations` to display sample course suggestions
- A form that posts to `/api/grade` and shows the returned score
- A simple chatbot interface using `/api/chat`
- `src/app.js` - Main React component.

Clicking the "Say Hello" button makes a request to the backend's `/api/hello` endpoint and displays the returned message.

The design uses a black background with gold accents to provide a modern, elegant appearance.

This directory will contain the React application responsible for the web interface. The app targets web, Android, and iOS platforms using responsive design principles.
