# Frontend

This directory contains a simple React application demonstrating the look and feel of the platform.

## Files

- `index.html` – Entry point that loads React and renders the application.
- `style.css` – Basic black and gold theme used across the pages.
- `src/app.js` – Main React component.


The app demonstrates several features:

- A "Say Hello" button that calls `/api/hello` and shows the response
- Fetching `/api/recommendations` to display sample course suggestions
- A form that posts to `/api/grade` and shows the returned score
- A simple chatbot interface using `/api/chat`

The design uses a black background with gold accents to provide a modern, elegant appearance.
