# Frontend

This directory contains a simple React application demonstrating the look and feel of the platform.
Clicking the "Say Hello" button makes a request to the backend's `/api/hello`
endpoint and displays the returned message.

Files
- `index.html` – Entry point that loads React and renders the application.
- `style.css` – Basic black and gold theme used across the pages.
- `src/app.js` – Main React component.
The design uses a black background with gold accents to provide a modern, elegant appearance.
This directory will contain the React application responsible for the web interface. The app targets web, Android, and iOS platforms using responsive design principles.
