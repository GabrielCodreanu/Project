# Frontend

This directory contains the React web application for the platform.

## Files

- `index.html` – Entry point that loads React, React Router, and Babel from CDNs and renders the application.
- `style.css` – Basic black and gold theme used across the pages.
- `src/app.js` – Application code using React Router and a small authentication context.


The app contains multiple pages (Home, Login, Register, Profile, Admin) and communicates with the backend API for authentication and course management.

The design uses a black background with gold accents to provide a modern, elegant appearance.
